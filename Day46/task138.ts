// Question 138:
// Describe how to use breakpoints in browser developer tools to debug JavaScript code.

// Explain & TIP: Breakpoints are a powerful feature in browser developer tools that allow you to pause the execution of your JavaScript code at a specific line. This gives you an opportunity to inspect variables, step through code one line at a time, and understand how your code executes in real-time.



// Answer:

// 1. Open the browser developer tools.

// 2. Click on the "Sources" tab.

// 3. Click on the "Breakpoints" tab.

// 4. Click on the "Add breakpoint" button.

// 5. Select the line number where you want to set a breakpoint.

// 6. Click on the "Add" button.

// 7. Click on the "Resume script execution" button to resume the execution of your JavaScript code.

// 8. When the breakpoint is reached, you will be able to inspect the variables, step through the code, and understand how your code executes.



console.log("Before BreakPoint");

console.log("This line has a breakpoint on it in the browser's developer tools");

console.log("After BreakPoint");
