// Question 70:
// Understanding let in Loops: Write a function that uses a loop with the let keyword to print numbers from 1 to 5. Explain how the let keyword affects the visibility of the loop variable.
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
// Explain & TIP: The let keyword provides block scope in JavaScript, which means variables declared with let inside a loop are only accessible within that loop. This helps avoid unintended interference with other parts of your code.
// Answer:
// Define a function that uses a loop with the let keyword to print numbers from 1 to 5
function printNumbers() {
    for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }
}
// Call the function
printNumbers();
