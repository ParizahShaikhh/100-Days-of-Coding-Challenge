// Question 119:
// Create a while loop that logs "Hello, World!" 5 times.
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
// Explain & TIP: A while loop continues to run as long as its condition remains true. Itâ€™s ideal for when you want to repeat something until a certain condition changes.
// Answer:
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log("Hello world!", i);
    i++;
}
